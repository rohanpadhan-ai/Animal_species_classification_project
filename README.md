# Animal_species_classification_project

This project uses deep learning to recognize different animal species from images. It uses popular CNN models like **ZFNet**, **VGG16**, and **GoogLeNet (Inception V1)** to compare performance and accuracy.

---

##  Goal

To build and compare CNN models that can correctly classify animals into 10 different categories.

---

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Animals-10 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10)
- **Classes**: 
  - Butterfly
  - Cat
  - Chicken
  - Cow
  - Dog
  - Elephant
  - Horse
  - Sheep
  - Spider
  - Squirrel  
- Around 28,000 images in total

---

## 🏗️ Models Used

- ZFNet  
- VGG16  
- GoogLeNet (Inception V1)  

Each model is trained and tested to see which performs best.

---

##  What We Measured

- Accuracy and loss during training and testing  
- Time taken by each model to make predictions

---

## 📈 Graphs and Charts

- Accuracy and loss curves
